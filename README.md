## Blog Application

This project is a sophisticated blog application built with React.js, featuring a backend powered by Appwrite. It showcases my ability to develop full-stack applications, manage user authentication, handle data persistence, and integrate with external services. The application provides a seamless experience for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts, complete with image uploads and secure user management.

## Key Features

- User Authentication & Authorization: Secure signup, login, and logout functionalities with session management, ensuring only authenticated users can create, edit, or delete posts.

- Post Management (CRUD): Users can create new blog posts, edit existing ones, delete their own posts, and view all active posts.

- Rich Text Editor Integration: For intuitive and flexible content creation.

- File Uploads & Previews: Seamlessly upload featured images for posts with file preview capabilities, enhancing the visual appeal of content.

- State Management with Redux Toolkit: Efficient and predictable state management using Redux Toolkit for authentication status and user data.

- Protected Routes: Implementing route protection to restrict access to certain pages (e.g., add post, edit post, all posts) to authenticated users only.

- Responsive Design: A user-friendly interface that adapts to various screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience.

- Modular & Reusable Components: Demonstrated through the use of Input.jsx for form fields and PostCard.jsx for displaying post summaries.

# Technologies Used

- Frontend: React.js, React Router DOM, Redux Toolkit, HTML, CSS
- Backend as a Service (BaaS): Appwrite (for Authentication, Databases, and Storage)
